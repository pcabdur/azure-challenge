Created a Resource Group:

Deployed a Web App on Azure App Service:

Web App Name: abdur-webapp-day2 (or your specific name)

Tech Stack: Default Linux/Windows App Service Plan

Resource Group: webapp-rg

Status: Running successfully

Budget Setup Attempted:

Tried to create a Zero Budget (nobill) to prevent overspending.

Faced CLI errors due to preview status and scope format.

‚ùó Final Decision: Budget creation will be done via Azure Portal.

Subscription Monitoring:

Queried all running resources to ensure no unnecessary charges.

Verified active services inside webapp-rg.

Spending Awareness:

Realized CLI errors could risk bill accumulation.

Took manual action to pause/stop unnecessary services.

üß† Lessons Learned:
Azure CLI can behave inconsistently for preview modules like az consumption.

Budget creation using CLI needs precise scope and sometimes version control.

The Portal view is safer for financial controls for beginners.

Always monitor what‚Äôs running, especially when credit is limited.
